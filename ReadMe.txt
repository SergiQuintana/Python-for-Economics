		´´´´´´´´´´´´´^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

		As an end of the course project you are required to 
		present the draft of a research proposal using data of 
		your choice. The idea is that you practise specially pandas
		for the data cleaning and matplotlib for visualizations. 

		Try to use that as a preliminary step for your master thesis!

		The project must be sent in the format of a jupyter notebook: 
		It will have to include: 
		1. A data set of your own choice (talk with me if you have no idea)
		2. Python code showing how you clean the data and how you produce
                   descriptive evidence. 
		3. Create some visualizations of your data set.

		With all these you have to sell me a story that motivates the choice
		of a particular topic of research. 
 
		Extra: 
		4. Try to do some regressions or other statistical models with your data.
		5. If you have a model in mind, provide the python equations for such a model. 
		   (You can always create a very simple toy model!)
