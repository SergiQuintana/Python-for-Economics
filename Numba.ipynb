It translates Python functions to optimized machine code at runtime using the industry-standard LLVM compiler library. Numba-compiled numerical algorithms in Python can approach the speeds of C or FORTRAN.\n",

    "Numba is a just-in-time compiler for Python that works best on code that uses NumPy arrays and functions, and loops. The most common way to use Numba is through its collection of decorators that can be applied to your functions to instruct Numba to compile them. When a call is made to a Numba-decorated function it is compiled to machine code “just-in-time” for execution and all or part of your code can subsequently run at native machine code speed!\n",

    "This depends on what your code looks like, if your code is numerically orientated (does a lot of math), uses NumPy a lot and/or has a lot of loops, then Numba is often a good choice. In these examples we’ll apply the most fundamental of Numba’s JIT decorators, @jit, to try and speed up some functions to demonstrate what works well and what does not.\n",

The behaviour of the nopython compilation mode is to essentially compile the decorated function so that it will run entirely without the involvement of the Python interpreter. This is the recommended and best-practice way to use the Numba jit decorator as it leads to the best performance.\n",
